### S-AGC -> N mistranslation:

* This may be random and likely known to you; but @Sina Rafiee had
observed some errors in S/N annotation in the file; but we also do
find quite some S->N substitutions in the final set. Among those the
most frequent serine codon in my current AAS codon frequency table was
AGC. This is somewhat consistent with the results reported here for a
very specific case:
